CLLeMens personal robot assistant with individual knowledge base: A project at Ruhr West University of Applied Sciences.
In today's world, where personalized services are becoming increasingly important, there is a growing demand for technologies that enable customization. The project at Hochschule Ruhr West in Bottrop, Germany, led by Alpay-Kaan Erbay, Jimmy Neitzert and Albert Makdisi, addresses this challenge by developing a personal robot assistant called 'CLLeMens'.
CLLeMens, powered by a Large Language Model (LLM) and integrated with an existing robotic platform, is designed to build a user's individual knowledge base and provide tailored answers. The core features of the project include the integration of an LLM using LangChain, the ability for users to add their own documents and media content in various formats such as PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD, Mp4, Mp3 and Ebooks, and a user-friendly web interface for document management.
A prominent feature of the project is the development of a fullstack webapp using Python Django on the backend and ReactJS on the frontend. The webapp is not only used to provide information about the project, but also provides a user interface for file upload and document management. Once uploaded, the files are stored in a database hosted on a Raspberry Pi, which in turn is integrated with the CLLeMens personal robot.
The webapp also offers a chat UI as an alternative to voice control with Amazon Alexa, allowing users to communicate directly with the AI. The responsive design of the webapp ensures that it looks good on mobile devices, although no dedicated mobile version is initially planned.
The project is a feasibility study, so document privacy and LLM performance measurement are not the primary focus points at this stage. However, user satisfaction and LLM performance will be assessed through a later survey.
The potential use cases for CLLeMens are diverse and range from academic to professional scenarios. For example, a student could integrate their course materials and books to help CLLeMens answer study-related questions. A business owner could add in-house documents to quickly access specific business data, and a researcher could integrate scholarly articles and data to use CLLeMens as a valuable resource when conducting research.
Successful implementation of the project could create a framework that demonstrates how personalized robotic assistants are able to effectively meet individual user needs. This could serve as a blueprint for future developments in the field, taking human-machine interaction to a new, personalized level.
